What did you change/enhance from part 1?</br></br>
- Part 2 focuessed alot on the back-end work. I created user authentication (using userCake) and Image uploads to gridster.</br>
  Serailizing the gridster object and making sure the new photos where added in an empty space with out overlap was tough. I also did alittle front end work creating the login and registartion page. </br></br>
  
If there was a third part to the class project, what would you like to implement?</br></br>
- I'd like to design a frontend from scratch using photoshop. I didn't get to work on the frontend as much since the backend took most of</br? the time. I'd also would like to secure my page to prevent cross site forgeries. I am paticulary concerned about my upload function.</br> I'm sure some one could send an Ajax request to  either empty the file where the grid serialization is saved </br> or they could upload photos with out being logged in.</br></br>

What did you learn between part 1 and part 2? </br></br>
- I learned alot about PHP in terms of back end scripting. It is a very flexable language compared to other web programming</br> langauges/packages. Sometimes i felt that PHP was too open ended. If I were to create a production web application I would use a</br> framework of some kinds due to this reason.</br></br>

What did you like about this project? How could it have been better? </br></br>
- I liked how the project was very open ended. I liked how there was some aspects of creativity compared to other programming project</br> The project could be better by implementing a MVC model or using an MVC framework.
