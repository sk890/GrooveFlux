# GrooveFlux Legacy

What did you change/enhance from part 1?</br></br>
  Part 2 focuessed alot on the back-end work. I created user authentication (using userCake) and Image uploads to gridster.</br>
  Serailizing the gridster object and making sure the new photos where added in an empty space with out overlap was tough. I also did a</br> little front end work creating the login and registartion page. </br></br>
  
If there was a third part to the class project, what would you like to implement?</br></br>
I'd like to design a frontend from scratch using photoshop. I didn't get to work on the frontend as much since the backend took most of</br? the time. I'd also would like to secure my page to prevent cross site forgeries. I am paticulary concerned about my upload function.</br> I'm sure some one could send an Ajax request to  either empty the file where the grid serialization is saved </br> or they could upload photos with out being logged in.</br></br>

What did you learn between part 1 and part 2? </br></br>

What did you like about this project? How could it have been better? <\br>
